Create and modify tiles in an immutable way. Made to be compatible with Redux.

## The Basics
This library makes use of tile areas which are very general and doesn't have any
specific requirements except for being an object looking something along the
lines of this:

```js
{
    width: Number,
    height: Number,
    tiles: [<Object>]
}
```

Other than that, you can add any property you want and put anything you want in
your tiles. For some operations however, Tile.tileId and Tile.tilesetId are used.
This includes the skipEmpty option for mergeTileAreas and the entire
fillTileAreaAt function.

It should also be noted that this library makes use of the immutable and
no side-effects patterns, meaning that you always get back the same output for
the same input and that input parameters are never modified.

## ES2015 Required
This library makes use of some of the new features in ES2015 without transpiling
them first. This means your environment needs to support ES2015. For node, that
is 6.0 or higher. If you want to run in browsers, Chrome and some others already
support ES2015, but if you want to make it compatible with older browsers,
you'll have to transpile it yourself using babel or equivalent.
