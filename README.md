developed for DTile, it could just as easily be used for any other project.

## Installation

```
$ npm install --save dtile-tilemap
```
You can then import the libraray with:
```JS
import { TileMap } from "dtile-tilemap"; // ES2015 required.
```

## ES2015 Required
This library makes use of some of the new features in ES2015 without transpiling
them first. This means your environment needs to support ES2015. For node, that
is 6.0 or higher. If you want to run in browsers, Chrome and some others already
support ES2015, but if you want to make it compatible with older browsers,
you'll have to transpile it yourself using babel or equivalent.
